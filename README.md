Welcome to FreeVueGuide, your go-to TV guide for a seamless viewing experience on Kodi. Our guide features user-friendly navigation, interchangeable skins, and customizable program lists to suit your individual preferences.

## About FreeVueGuide

FreeVueGuide is not just an ordinary TV guide; it is a comprehensive tool that integrates with your favorite add-ons, allowing you to stream directly from within the guide. Our aim is to keep this repository up-to-date with tips and tricks to help you get the most out of FreeVueGuide.

### Key Features

- **Interchangeable Skins**: Customize the look and feel of your guide with various skin options.

- **Add-on Integration**: Link directly to your preferred add-ons and stream content effortlessly.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed to provide an intuitive and seamless experience for all users.

## Upcoming Changes

We are excited to announce that FreeVueGuide will soon implement a username and password system. This measure is being introduced to protect the integrity of this free add-on and prevent misuse or unauthorized sales.

### Important Note

This does not mean that FreeVueGuide is becoming a paid service. The username and password requirement is solely for the purpose of safeguarding the add-on.

### Obtaining Your Username and Password

Details on how to obtain your username and password will be posted on our website. Stay tuned for updates and further information.

## Enhanced Integration with Kodi Add-ons

FreeVueGuide aims to provide a better user experience by integrating more deeply with various Kodi add-ons. This enhanced integration will allow users to:

- **Streamline Navigation**: Seamlessly browse and select content from multiple add-ons directly within FreeVueGuide.
- **Unified Search**: Perform searches across all integrated add-ons to find content quickly and easily.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Get tailored content recommendations based on your viewing habits and preferences.

### Custom Kodi Skin for Better Integration

To further enhance the user experience, we are exploring the development of a custom Kodi skin designed specifically for FreeVueGuide. This custom skin will offer:

- **Optimized Layout**: A layout tailored to make navigation and content discovery more intuitive.
- **Consistent Design**: A cohesive design that complements the features of FreeVueGuide and provides a visually appealing interface.

However, note that we have **no control** over the destination of the link, and just removing the link from the playlist will not remove its contents from the web.
